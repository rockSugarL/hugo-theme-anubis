Configuring your Blog

Recommendation: Add SectionPagesMenu to your config.toml file. Recommendation: Don't set a menu in your post's Front Matter unless you want it to display on the navigation. Recommendation: Customize the menus that get an RSS icon by adding the RSSSections parameter to your config.toml file. Recommendation: Configure the menu items by adding menu.main sections to your config.toml file.

Creating a Link Post
Sometimes you want a post that just links to another website. This can be done by including the externalurl parameter on your individual post. A link post is just a normal post under posts that has this special parameter. For example, on a post talking about some kickstarter project, you can add this to your individual post's Front Matter:

externalurl = "http://kickstarter.com"
These posts are rendered slightly different with an → to signify that it is remote.
